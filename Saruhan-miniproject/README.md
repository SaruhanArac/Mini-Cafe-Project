2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script with Python:


How did your design go about meeting the projects requirements?:

- My design approach ensured meeting project requirements through client collaboration, modular system structuring, robust CSV data handling, and an command-line interface, as explained above.


How did you gurantee the projects requirements?:

- I ensured the fulfillment of these requirements by closely engaging with the requriements week by week designing a modular system, implementing robust data handling, developing a user-friendly CLI interface.

If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?


- If I had more time, I would have wanted to integrate databases instead of CSV files for data storage to improve scalability and data management capabilities. Additionally, I should have separated my functions into a separate file to enhance code organization and maintainability.

What did you enjoy most implementing in your code?

- What I enjoyed most during implementation was creating a clear and user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that seamlessly guided users through managing products, couriers, and orders. This involved designing intuitive menu options and ensuring smooth interaction flows, which contributed to a satisfying user experience.
